This project allows users to search technical blogs! Built with Python, React, HTML, CSS, and SQLite.

<br>

There are three core modules:

- `crawler.py` ‚Äî a web crawler that utilizes the `requests` module to crawl entire websites from a seed file in `db/seed.yaml`

- `indexer.py` ‚Äî an indexer which exports functionality to store websites in an SQLite database with efficient indexing

- `query.py` ‚Äî a query module which, given a search term, retrieves and ranks websites by three heuristics (frequency, location, distance)


<br>

A Flask application in `server.py` serves a React application that allows users to interact with the project.
